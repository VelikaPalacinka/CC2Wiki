					<h3>AWACS = 41</h3>
					<p>Aircraft Radar.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>AirObsCam = 39</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>BattleDroids = 100</h3>
					<p>Mule deployable droid box.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Bomb0 = 31</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Bomb1 = 32</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Bomb2 = 33</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>CIWS = 24</h3>
					<p>
						Ground-mounted anti-missile/anti-aircraft defence. Only has 100 shots in
						it's magazine but is deadly against slow moving aircraft.
					</p>
					<p>
						When under manual control you can still shoot at ground units with these
						but they only inflict a very minor amount of damage (a CIWS turret will
						take nearly 5 minutes of constant fire to kill a Bear)
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>ShipCruiseMissile = 28</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>ShipCounterMeasure = 76</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>ShipFlare = 29</h3>
					<p>
						When used by the carrier, consumes regular "flares" from stock to provide
						illumunation. Unfortunately flares launched this way do not have any
						impact on incoming heat guided missiles.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>ShipCIWS = 26</h3>
					<p>
						CIWS gun for ships, unlike ground CIWS these tend to be mounted on
						attachments that have movement limits. They can only aim and fire within
						the allowed arc (see the chassis xml <code>attachment</code> for carrier
						and fish)
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>ShipCam = 30</h3>
					<p>
						This is the observation camera mounted on the carrier. It seems
						functionally identical to the Observation camera for ground units except
						it has a physically larger model. With save editing this can be mounted on
						every other unit and works.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>DriverSeat = 38</h3>
					<p>
						Special implicit attachment that all player-drivable units are spawned
						with in slot 0
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Flares = 43</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>FuelTank = 42</h3>
					<p>Aircraft drop tank. Contains 1000l of fuel.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Gun100mm = 18</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Gun120mm = 19</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>ShipGun160mm = 20</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Gun15mm = 87</h3>
					<p>
						Tiny turret, most often seen on 1-shield islands, actually fires 30mm
						ammo.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unlike the other turrets you can write lua scripting to equip this on any
						docked unit regardless of the fact you can't have them in stock. Several
						mods make use of this to allow these turrets to be equipped on ground
						units (or the Carrier).
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Gun20mm = 21</h3>
					<p>Aircraft 20mm gun, very accurate.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Gun30mm = 17</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Gun40mm = 85</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>MissileAA = 36</h3>
					<p>Single AA missile hardpoint.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>MissileAALauncher = 27</h3>
					<p>
						Warship AA missile launcher, sadly only works when mounted on Needlefish,
						Swordfish or the carrier (and powered on) When mounted on a land turret or
						ground unit, it never fires.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>MissileIR = 34</h3>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>MissileIRLauncher = 25</h3>
					<p>
						Re-loadable IR missile launcher (has a magazine for 4 missiles). Often
						seen on Seals, Walrus and Ground Turrets.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>MissileLaser = 35</h3>
					<p>
						Operated similar to the cruise missile except that it is air-launched and
						has a relatively short range. Deals low damage (2 are required to kill a
						Seal). The lua scripting hints at different laser codes, which are
						probably used internally to allow multiple pilots to shoot at different
						laser targets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like the TV missile they trigger automatic flare launchers but are not
						otherwise impacted by them.
					</p>
					<p>The AI never seems to fire these</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>MissileTV = 72</h3>
					<p>
						Player controllable guided missile, similar in spirit to the Wire-Guided
						missile of CC1 or the AGM-65 Maverick missile.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like other missiles, it triggers flare launchers but is not impacted by
						them.
					</p>
					<p>The AI never seems to fire these.</p>

					<h3>Noisemaker = 73</h3>

				<article>
					<h3>Rearm120mm = 94</h3>
					<p>Resupply box for Mule</p>

				<article>
					<h3>Rearm20mm = 90</h3>
					<p>Resupply box for Mule</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Rearm30mm = 91</h3>
					<p>Resupply box for Mule</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Rearm40mm = 92</h3>
					<p>Resupply box for Mule</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>RearmIR = 96</h3>
					<p>Resupply box for Mule</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Refuel = 95</h3>
					<p>Resupply fuel tank for Mule</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>RocketPod = 22</h3>
					<p>
						Explosive rocket launcher, contains 19 rockets. Lots of fun but can be
						tricky to aim.
					</p>
					<p>Like missiles, it also triggers flare launchers.</p>
					<p>Rockets can sometimes malfunction and veer off target significantly.</p>
					<p>
						CIWS does not seem to try to intercept these, but they may just be too
						fast.
