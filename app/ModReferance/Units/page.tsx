				<article>
					<h3>Albatross = 8</h3>
					<p>
						Classic fixed-wing aircraft. 4 weapon hardpoints, one aircraft turret
						mount, and no utility points.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Barge = 16</h3>
					<p>
						Carries cargo and fuel from islands to carriers. Can be driven by humans.
						Does not seem to consume fuel.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Bear = 6</h3>
					<p>
						Tracked vehicle, can mount 100mm guns and 120mm artillery, has 2 utility
						points.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Carrier = 0</h3>
					<p>The player carrier.</p>
					<p>
						14 x ship hardpoints (ship camera, naval gun, naval ciws, cruise missile,
						torpedoes, flare launcher etc)
					</p>
					<p>8 x ground unit bays 8 x air unit bays 1 x lifeboat bay</p>
					<p>
						The carrier is special in that air and ground units can be
						embarked/unloaded. It can also re-supply ships with fuel and ammunition.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Droid = 97</h3>
					<p>Combat droids deployed by the MULE</p>
					<p>
						Droids actually have 2x high-repeat 30mm guns that seem to deal MUCH more
						damage than the 40mm gun.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Jetty = 64</h3>
					<p>
						This is actually called "drydock" in the Lua. It is where your main
						carrier is launched from when you start a new game. It cannot be destroyed
						and cannot move.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Lifeboat = 57</h3>
					<p>
						The little orange escape pod on the port side of your Carrier. Through
						scripting you can deploy it but it cannot (yet) be driven around.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Manta = 10</h3>
					<p>
						Fast jet, 4 weapon hardpoints, 1 aircraft camera, 1 AWACS, 2 utility
						points.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Mule = 88</h3>
					<p>Ground support unit, 6 "special" resupply boxes.</p>
					<p>
						The Mule can re-supply fuel, IR missiles and ammunition to ground units
						(and ships I think - bredroll) but sadly not aircraft.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Needlefish = 77</h3>
					<p>
						Small warship, very fast, has 2 ship hardpoints. Can be mounted with any
						other normal weapon through save-editing.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Petrel = 14</h3>
					<p>
						Heavy-lift air transport, 4 wing hardpoints, 1 aircraft camera. Can
						airlift any ground unit (except turrets, droids or virus bots).
					</p>
					<p>
						Interesting fact, when carried by a Petrel, a ground unit is invulnerable
						and uses no fuel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through save editing, can be made to carry aircraft or needlefish (though
						not for long).
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Razorbill = 12</h3>
					<p>Small agile helo, 2 aircraft weapon points, 2 utility points.</p>
				</article>

				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Turret = 59</h3>
					<p>
						Buildable ground turret, vanilla game will carry IR missile, CIWS, 30mm,
						40mm or 15mm gun. Through save edits and/or XML changes they can carry and
						use other attachments
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>

						than a seal
